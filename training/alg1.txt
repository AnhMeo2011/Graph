TRAINING MATERIAL: TRANSLATING VERBAL DESCRIPTIONS OF FUNCTIONS INTO FORMAL ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS

Goal of the model
The AI receives a natural-language description of a mathematical function and must output the corresponding algebraic expression. The scope is intermediate algebra, not advanced calculus. The AI should correctly interpret common mathematical language, translate operations, respect order of operations, and standardize expressions.

The output should be a formal expression using standard algebraic notation.

SECTION 1 — GENERAL PRINCIPLES

    Identify the main variable.
    Most descriptions refer to a variable such as x, t, or n. If not specified, assume x.

Example:
"Three times a number plus five."
→ number corresponds to x
Result: 3x + 5

    Identify operations in order.
    Natural language may describe operations in different orders. Determine what is applied first.

Example:
"Five added to twice a number"
Means: 2x first, then +5
Result: 2x + 5

    Respect grouping words.
    Words such as:

    quantity
    sum
    difference
    total
    result of
    usually indicate parentheses.

Example:
"Twice the sum of x and 3"
Result: 2(x + 3)

    Maintain standard algebra form.
    Use standard formatting:

    multiplication written as coefficient next to variable
    parentheses where needed
    exponent notation for powers

Example:
"x multiplied by x"
Result: x^2

    Avoid unnecessary parentheses but preserve meaning.

SECTION 2 — COMMON WORDING TO OPERATION MAPPING

Addition phrases:

    plus
    added to
    increased by
    sum of
    total of
    more than

Examples:
"x plus 7" → x + 7
"7 more than x" → x + 7
"sum of x and y" → x + y

Important order rule:
"A more than B" means B + A.

Example:
"5 more than x" → x + 5

Subtraction phrases:

    minus
    decreased by
    difference of
    less than
    subtracted from

Examples:
"x minus 3" → x − 3
"3 less than x" → x − 3
"difference of x and 4" → x − 4

Order reversal rule:
"A less than B" means B − A.

Example:
"5 less than x" → x − 5

Multiplication phrases:

    times
    multiplied by
    product of
    twice
    triple
    double
    of (often multiplication)

Examples:
"3 times x" → 3x
"product of x and 4" → 4x
"twice x" → 2x
"half of x" → x/2

Division phrases:

    divided by
    quotient of
    ratio of
    per

Examples:
"x divided by 5" → x/5
"quotient of x and y" → x/y

SECTION 3 — POWERS AND ROOTS

Square and cube:
"square of x" → x^2
"cube of x" → x^3

General power:
"x to the power of 5" → x^5

Roots:
"square root of x" → √x or x^(1/2)
"cube root of x" → x^(1/3)

Root grouping:
"square root of the sum of x and 3"
→ √(x + 3)

SECTION 4 — FUNCTION STRUCTURE PHRASES

Expressions often describe transformations.

Example patterns:

    Scaling
    "three times the function"
    → 3f(x)
    Shifts
    "function increased by 4"
    → f(x) + 4
    Horizontal shifts
    "x minus 2 inside the function"
    → f(x − 2)

Example:
"square of x minus 2"
Means (x − 2)^2, not x^2 − 2.

SECTION 5 — ORDER OF OPERATIONS LANGUAGE

Language may describe operations sequentially.

Example:
"Take a number, multiply it by 3, then subtract 4."
Result: 3x − 4

Another:
"A number increased by 5, then squared."
Result: (x + 5)^2

Words indicating sequence:

    then
    after that
    the result is
    next

SECTION 6 — COMMON FUNCTION TYPES

Linear functions:
Descriptions often use:

    constant rate
    increases by
    slope
    linear relation

Example:
"Three times x plus one"
→ 3x + 1

Quadratic:
Examples:
"x squared plus five"
→ x^2 + 5

Absolute value:
"absolute value of x minus 3"
→ |x − 3|

Rational:
"one divided by x plus two"
→ 1/(x + 2)

SECTION 7 — TRANSLATION STRATEGY

Step-by-step reasoning:

    Identify variable.
    Detect operations.
    Detect grouping words.
    Apply order rules.
    Write expression.
    Simplify notation.

SECTION 8 — EDGE CASES

Reversed subtraction:
"4 subtracted from x"
→ x − 4

Nested descriptions:
"twice the difference between x and 3"
→ 2(x − 3)

Compound:
"half the sum of x squared and 5"
→ (x^2 + 5)/2

Multiple operations:
"three less than twice x"
→ 2x − 3

SECTION 9 — TRAINING EXAMPLES

Examples should map descriptions to outputs.

Example set:

Input: "Five added to a number"
Output: f(x) = x + 5

Input: "Three times a number minus seven"
Output: f(x) = 3x − 7

Input: "Square of the sum of x and 4"
Output: f(x) = (x + 4)^2

Input: "Half of x increased by 6"
Output: f(x) = x/2 + 6

Input: "Difference between x and 9"
Output: f(x) = x − 9

Input: "Product of 4 and x minus 2"
Output: f(x) = 4(x − 2)

Input: "One over x plus five"
Output: f(x) = 1/(x + 5)

Input: "Seven less than twice x"
Output: f(x) = 2x − 7

Input: "Square root of x plus 1"
Output: f(x) = √(x + 1)

Input: "Cube of x minus 2"
Output: f(x) = (x − 2)^3

SECTION 10 — NORMALIZATION RULES

Model should normalize expressions:

Preferred:
2(x + 3)
not
(2)(x + 3)

Preferred:
3x
not
3*x

Use parentheses when ambiguity exists.

SECTION 11 — COMMON ERROR PATTERNS TO AVOID

Error: misordering subtraction.
Wrong: 5 − x
Correct for "5 less than x": x − 5

Error: missing parentheses.
Wrong: 2x + 3 for "twice the sum of x and 3"
Correct: 2(x + 3)

Error: distributing incorrectly without instruction.
