TRAINING MATERIAL: TRANSLATING TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTION DESCRIPTIONS INTO FORMAL EXPRESSIONS

Goal of the model
The AI receives a natural-language description involving trigonometric functions and must output the correct formal mathematical expression. The AI does not need advanced trigonometry or calculus; it only needs to translate descriptions into correct symbolic form.

The focus is on:
• recognizing trig functions in language
• interpreting grouping and order of operations
• translating transformations and combinations
• producing standardized expressions

SECTION 1 — CORE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS

Primary trig functions:

sine → sin(x)
cosine → cos(x)
tangent → tan(x)

Reciprocal trig functions:

secant → sec(x)
cosecant → csc(x)
cotangent → cot(x)

Examples:

"sine of x" → sin(x)
"cosine of a number" → cos(x)
"tangent of twice a number" → tan(2x)

SECTION 2 — BASIC TRANSLATION RULES

    The trig function acts on an input expression.
    The argument goes inside parentheses.

Example:
"sine of x plus 3" → sin(x + 3)

    Words indicating grouping require parentheses.

Example:
"sine of the sum of x and 3" → sin(x + 3)

    Operations outside trig functions apply afterward.

Example:
"twice the sine of x" → 2 sin(x)

    Respect order of operations.

Example:
"sine of x squared"
means sin(x^2), not (sin(x))^2.

SECTION 3 — COMMON LANGUAGE PATTERNS

Direct function use:

sine of x → sin(x)
cosine of x → cos(x)
tangent of x → tan(x)

Scaled functions:

three times sine of x → 3 sin(x)
half the cosine of x → (1/2) cos(x)

Shifted inputs:

sine of x plus two → sin(x + 2)
cosine of x minus five → cos(x − 5)

Grouped inputs:

tangent of the difference between x and 4 → tan(x − 4)

SECTION 4 — POWERS OF TRIG FUNCTIONS

Two common forms appear in language.

    Function squared:

"sine squared of x"
→ sin²(x)
→ equivalent to (sin(x))²

    Square of sine:

"square of sine of x"
→ (sin(x))²

These usually mean the same thing.

Examples:

cosine squared of x → cos²(x)
square of tangent of x → tan²(x)

SECTION 5 — OPERATIONS WITH TRIG FUNCTIONS

Addition:

sine of x plus cosine of x
→ sin(x) + cos(x)

Multiplication:

sine of x times cosine of x
→ sin(x) cos(x)

Division:

sine of x divided by cosine of x
→ sin(x) / cos(x)

Example combinations:

three times sine of x plus five
→ 3 sin(x) + 5

one over cosine of x
→ 1 / cos(x)

SECTION 6 — INPUT TRANSFORMATIONS

Trig functions often receive transformed inputs.

Horizontal shifts:

sine of x minus 2 → sin(x − 2)

Scaling input:

sine of 3x → sin(3x)

Combined:

cosine of 2x plus 1 → cos(2x + 1)

SECTION 7 — SEQUENTIAL OPERATION DESCRIPTIONS

Language may describe steps.

Example:
"Take the sine of a number and then square the result."
→ (sin(x))²

Example:
"Add three to a number and take the cosine."
→ cos(x + 3)

Sequence indicators include:

    then
    after
    next
    the result

SECTION 8 — INVERSE TRIG FUNCTIONS (OPTIONAL SUPPORT)

Inverse trig functions appear as:

arcsin(x)
arccos(x)
arctan(x)

Language examples:

inverse sine of x → arcsin(x)
arctangent of a number → arctan(x)

If included, treat them as standard functions.

SECTION 9 — ROOTS AND FRACTIONS WITH TRIG

Examples:

square root of sine of x → √(sin(x))

one divided by sine of x → 1 / sin(x)

square root of cosine squared of x → √(cos²(x))

SECTION 10 — COMMON ERROR CASES

    Misplacing parentheses.

Wrong:
sin(x) + 3

Correct for:
"sine of x plus 3"
→ sin(x + 3)

    Confusing squared input and squared function.

sin(x^2) ≠ (sin(x))^2

    Forgetting grouping words.

"sine of the sum of x and 1"
requires parentheses:
sin(x + 1)

SECTION 11 — TRAINING EXAMPLES

Input → Output examples.

sine of x
→ sin(x)

cosine of x plus three
→ cos(x + 3)

twice the sine of x
→ 2 sin(x)

square of cosine of x
→ cos²(x)

sine of twice a number
→ sin(2x)

one over tangent of x
→ 1 / tan(x)

three times sine of x minus four
→ 3 sin(x) − 4

sine of the square of x
→ sin(x^2)

square root of cosine of x plus one
→ √(cos(x + 1))

difference between sine of x and cosine of x
→ sin(x) − cos(x)

SECTION 12 — NORMALIZATION RULES

Preferred output styles:

sin(x), not sin x
cos(x), not cos x

Use parentheses when argument is complex.

Prefer:
sin²(x)
instead of
(sin(x))² unless clarity is needed.

SECTION 13 — TRAINING OBJECTIVES

The AI should learn to:

• recognize trig function names
• correctly group expressions
• preserve operation order
• translate sequential instructions
• distinguish input transformations vs output operations
• output clean algebraic expressions

Advanced trig identities or calculus are not required.
